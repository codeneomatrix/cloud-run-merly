Merly is a micro framework for declaring routes and handling requests. Quickly creating web applications in Julia with minimal effort.


This repository contains the source code of a sample Merly application that is
distributed as the public container image (`gcr.io/cloudrun/hello`) used in the
[Cloud Run quickstart](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/quickstarts/) and as
the suggested container image  in the Cloud Run UI on Cloud Console.
